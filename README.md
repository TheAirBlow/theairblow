## Hello there!
I'm a completely random person on the internet, or perhaps, just a pigment of your imagination. \
Usually making stuff out of pure boredom and lack of better things to do.
## What do I know?
1) **C#** - My personal favourite, unfortunately owned by michaelsoft. Have been using it for years in projects of all sizes.
2) **JavaScript** - You hate it, and you love it. Mainly browser plugin and frontend development (vanilla, vue or nuxt.js)
3) **Java** - Mostly Minecraft mod and Android development. Absolute boilerplate hell.
4) **C/C++** - Decent base of knowledge, but I don't use it in any public projects of mine.
5) **Python** - Making quick and dirty scripts, and sometimes entire projects out of spite.
6) **Lua** - [OpenComputers](https://github.com/TheAirBlow/GooberScripts/)... Yeah, that's it. 
7) **Linux** - I use arch btw™
