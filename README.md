## Hello there! I am a fellow Russian that does things.
Usually making totally random stuff because of being bored.

## What do I know?
1) C# my beloved. Decent knowledge of ASP.NET and the Unity game engine.
2) Javascript, mainly addon and frontend development. Imagine having types!
3) C/C++, tried to make an OS (totally random thought, and here we are)
4) Java, have made a lot of Minecraft mods. ~~I hate it.~~

## Language Statistics
![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=TheAirBlow&layout=compact)

## Opinions and stuff
1) I absolutely hate rust and ruby, they're unreadable compared to other launguages.
2) I have a cute cat. Also, [click here](https://wipet.malwarewatch.org/), please.
