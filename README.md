## Hello there! I am a fellow Russian that does things.
Usually making totally random stuff because of being bored. \
You can see more of my projects on [sussy.dev's GitLab](https://git.sussy.dev/explore).

## What do I know?
1) C# is the best. Decent knowledge of ASP.NET and the Unity game engine.
2) JavaScript, mainly addon and frontend development. Imagine having types!
3) C/C++, tried to make a kernel (totally random thought, yet here we are)
4) The syscalls necessary for USB communication. Don't judge me!
5) Java, I've made a lot of Minecraft mods. ~~I absolutely hate it.~~.
