## Hello there! I am a fellow Russian that does things.
Usually making totally random stuff because of being bored.

## What do I know?
1) C# is my beloved. Decent knowledge of ASP.NET, Windows.Forms and Avalonia
2) Javascript, mainly addon development. Very little knowledge of discord.js and express.
3) C/C++, tried to make an OS (totally random thought, and here we are)
4) Java, but only basic Fabric mods of Spigot plugins. ~~I hate it.~~

## Fun facts
1) I hate rust/ruby very much, they're unreadable compared to other launguages.
2) Very homophobic, at least I can hide it in most situations.
3) I have a cute cat. Also, [click here](https://wipet.malwarewatch.org/), please.
